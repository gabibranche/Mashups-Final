# Progress Report 3

## What we planned to do by today:

* Hatim: Rhythm Music Type
* Gabi: Using Yandex API

## What we did:

### Gabi 

#### Using Yandex

The first thing I did was figuring out how to use the yandex code. The API is fairly straight forward but the documentation was a bit misleading in terms of how to access the API. However after talking to Jack, we figured out the correct syntax for calling the API. See [Test1 Code](https://github.com/gabibranche/Mashups-Final/blob/master/Code/test-code/yandex/test1_learningAPI.html).

#### Collecting words to translate

Once I was able to enter words directly with the URL and translate them based on an array of languages, the next step was to input a word from the user that could be fed to the API and then translated. I did this by using input tag and storing the word in a variable that I added to the url rather than putting the word directly into the URL. See [Test2 Code](https://github.com/gabibranche/Mashups-Final/blob/master/Code/test-code/yandex/test2_inputingText.html).

#### Storing the translations

In order to time the display the translations properly, I needed to store them in it's own array. I still haven't figured out the time delay yet but right now I can push the translations into it's own array.

### Hatim


## Challenges

### Gabi

There are two current challenges being faced:

#### Sleep Function
Right now the translations aren't looping in a timed sequence which means that one cannot read the translations before they are replaced with another translation. 
<br>
I will be talking to Jack about fixing this problem.

#### Storing translations?
Right now I am storing the translations per word. However I think this will be impractical once I begin to collect new words without refreshing as this method would generate too many arrays for each word. 
<br>
I think once we figure out how to update without refreshing this will be easier to tackle.

### Hatim


## Next Steps
