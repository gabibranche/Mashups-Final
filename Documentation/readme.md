# The Global Music Machine

## Synopsis

The Global Music Machine allows you to make music by using your very definition of music. It is a website which allows the user to input a word that they think answers the question *What Is Music?*. Their word generates a beat that compliments the generation of a world map and translations oof the word they intered in ober 100 languages. Once the user is finished interacting with out website, they can then see what other words were inputted using the gloabl music machine. 


## Inspiration

The creators of this website both love music very much and wanted to showcase their love for music in a creative way. Being from opposite sides of the globe (namely Trinidad and Tobago and Morocco), they have an acute sense of the fact that music transcends physical and linguistic boarders. The global music machine is supposed to outline the fact that music is a universal language and the same words are used to describe it no matter where we are in the world. We hope that through using our website, the user will come to a common understanding that the world is smaller than we believe and music are our bridges.

## Building Blocks

This site is largely dependent on:

* p5
* d3
* Yandex Translation API
* Express js
* node js
* AJAX


## Navigating our Github Repo

The site is separated into 2 parts:

**The Code** provides you with all the files needed to run the site. They will need to be downloaded and the local host would need to be started in the using *npm start* to allow for the word cloud to be updated.
<br>
The code has been commented to show what the various instructions do. The main script is called *script* and the main html file is called *index.html*

**Documentation** is set out in the form of progress reports showing a step by step process on how we worked on the project. In the Documentation folder, a sub folder can be found with some of the links and resources used when first researching this project.

## Reflection

This website was very fun to make. We both learnt a great deal from making it and aquired skills that we could apply in future projects. This project can still be improved greatly to reach publishing level. However given the time constraint and our skill level, we are very proud of what we accomplished. Enjoy!
